I am **Haina Wang**, currently pursuing my M.S. degree in Computer Science at the **University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego)** (expected graduation 2026). I am advised by [**Prof. Hao Su**](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and work closely with [**Liu Dai**](https://liudai.notion.site/), one of his Ph.D. students. Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Zhejiang University** (ZJU), where I was advised by [**Prof. Can Wang**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/canwang) and also collaborated with [**Prof. Gaoang Wang**](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/node/780) during a Student Research Training Program (SRTP).


During my undergraduate career, I participated in **ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)** for two years. I have also gained relevant industry experience through internships as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) and Researcher at **Huatai Securities**, **Light Chaser Animation Co.**, and **Bytedance Co.**

My current research enthusiasm is focused on **Embodied AI & Decision-Making**, dedicated to building and optimizing next-generation **Vision-Language Models (VLM)** for more general intelligence. My goal is to translate cutting-edge AI theories into efficient and reliable real-world systems.
