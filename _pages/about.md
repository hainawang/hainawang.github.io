I am **Haina Wang**, currently pursuing my M.S. degree in Computer Science at the **University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego)** (expected graduation). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Zhejiang University** (ZJU), where I was advised by **Prof. Can Wang** and also collaborated with **Prof. Gaoang Wang** during a Student Research Training Program (SRTP).

During my undergraduate career, I participated in **ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)** for two years. I have also gained relevant industry experience through internships as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) and Researcher at **Huatai Securities**, **Light Chaser Animation Co.**, and **Bytedance Co.**

My current research enthusiasm is focused on **Embodied AI & Decision-Making**, dedicated to building and optimizing next-generation **Vision-Language Models (VLM)** for more general intelligence. My goal is to translate cutting-edge AI theories into efficient and reliable real-world systems.
