ManiTaskGen is introduced as a novel system that addresses this limitation by automatically generating a comprehensive, diverse, and logically near-exhaustive set of mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. This system provides a crucial resource for both the rigorous evaluation and iterative improvement of Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) on embodied decision-making.
